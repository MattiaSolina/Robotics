I'm trying to realize a robotic arm with 6 revolut joints controlled by an external joystick similar with the model. The idea is that we move this little copy of the main robot and it moves accordingly with the provide commands. I'm thinking also to implement a way to gave command about the point, in the operational space, that we want that the end effector reaches using the inverse kinematics and if it works, go on making more autonomous the robot, implementing sensors that found object in the environment and implementing tasks of pick and place of these small objects.
